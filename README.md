## Hi, Welcome to Jonathan Ma's github,

#### I'm a materials engineer by trade but a curious person at heart. 

#### My git hub is more or less an anthology of codes, consisting of a various project over different stages of my life. From Monte Carlo simulations to scripts I use to streamline Quantum chemistry computations to a pet project where I wrote an app because I needed to find a spot to park my bike. I did everything from AWS backend to graphics design.

- #### In the [the Monte Carlo Electron Simulation](https://github.com/jonhsma/CXRO_ElectronInteractions), I used SIMD matlab enabled linear speed up.
- #### I also participated in the open source development of [Openllemetry](https://github.com/jonhsma/openllmetry).
- #### In case it's useful to somebody, there are scripts for [parsing Q-Chem data](https://github.com/jonhsma/QChem-analytics) and [managing HPC](https://github.com/jonhsma/LRC-MISC)
