Hi, this is Jonathan Ma,

I'm a material sicentist (sort of) by trade but a curious person at heart. 

i'm about to graduate from UC Berkeley with a physics PhD but my work is where materials sciences, chemistry, physics, and electrical engineering meets.

My git hub is more or less an anthology of codes, which ranges from Monte Carlo simulations to scripts I use to stream line Quantum chemistry computations.
