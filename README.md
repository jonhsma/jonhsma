Hi, this is Jonathan Ma,

I'm a material sicentist/engineer (sort of) by trade but a curious person at heart. 

Graduated from UC Berkeley with a PhD in physics, but my work is where materials science, chemistry, physics, and electrical engineering meet.

My git hub is more or less an anthology of codes, consisting of a variety of things from Monte Carlo simulations to scripts I use to streamline Quantum chemistry computations. Also there is a pet project where I wrote an app because I needed to find a spot to park my bike. I did everything from AWS backend to graphics design. Sorta full-stack. I've learnt a lot in the process but I'm not maintaining it anymore.
