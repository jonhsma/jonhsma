Hi, this is Jonathan Ma,

I'm a materials engineer (sort of) by trade but a curious person at heart. 

My git hub is more or less an anthology of codes, consisting of a variety of things from Monte Carlo simulations to scripts I use to streamline Quantum chemistry computations. 
Also there is a pet project where I wrote an app because I needed to find a spot to park my bike. I did everything from AWS backend to graphics design.
