Hi, this is Jonathan Ma,

I'm a material sicentist/engineer (sort of) by trade but a curious person at heart. 

Graduateed from UC Berkeley with a physics PhD but my work is where materials sciences, chemistry, physics, and electrical engineering meets.

My git hub is more or less an anthology of codes, which ranges from Monte Carlo simulations to scripts I use to stream line Quantum chemistry computations. Also there is a pet project where I wrote an app because I needed to find a spot to park my bike. I did everything from AWS backend to graphics design. Sorta full-stack. I've learnt a lot in the process but I'm not maintaining it anymore.
