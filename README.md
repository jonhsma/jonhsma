## Hi, Welcome to Jonathan Ma's github,

#### I'm a materials engineer by trade but a curious person at heart. 

#### My git hub is more or less an anthology of codes, consisting of a various project over different stages of my life. From Monte Carlo simulations to scripts I use to streamline Quantum chemistry computations to a pet project where I wrote an app because I needed to find a spot to park my bike. I did everything from AWS backend to graphics design.
